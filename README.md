### Hi there, I'm Simona ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced architect, but some time ago, I decided to change my career path. I became interested in programming over a year ago, and since then, I have been learning it independently. I started with learning frontend development and created a few applications using Angular (you can check them out on my GitHub). Currently, I am learning Java with Spring Boot to be able to work on both frontend and backend development in the future. I am a hardworking person, focused on personal development and continuous learning. My previous position has taught me logical thinking, teamwork, attention to detail, and creativity.

Tech stack: 
- Angular,
- TypeScript,
- JavaScript,
- Java,
- Spring Boot,
- Bootstrap,
- HTML, CSS, SCSS,
- unit testing (Jasmine),
- SQL,
- Git.
